# Website
A website made for my goals in gifted at my school, MMS.

# Design
I am going for a minimalist design with plenty of light colors.  Attempting to stay away from rounded elements and delayed responses to certain user interface elements, such as buttons, checkboxes, radiobuttons, etc..

# Code
The code for this website will be written with many preproccesors.  This is highly impractical, but makes the code more readable and better for this specific project.  The main languages used will be SASS, jQuery, and JADE.
